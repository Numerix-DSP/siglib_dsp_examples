INTRODUCTION

The files in this folder provide examples for accessing SigLib source
files from C#. They are designed to work with Visual C# Express 2008.

There are two sub-folders :
	Direct - A direct calling to the SigLib DLL
	SWIG - A SWIG compatible SigLib interface

If you wish to use a different version of Visual Studio to the one supplied
then you should create a project in Visual Studio and import the code from
Program.cs.

Please read the appropriate section of the SigLib reference manual for
further information.

Visual C# Express 2008 can be downloaded from www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/.

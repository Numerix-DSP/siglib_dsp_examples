            Visual Basic Test Program For SigLib DLL


INTRODUCTION

This program is written for and tested with the 32 bit Visual Basic 6.00.
This directory includes SigLibGlobal.bas, which contains the SigLib
function declarations.

If you wish to use this example please ensure that you have read the section
of the SigLib User's Guide entitled "Using The SigLib DLL With Microsoft
Visual Basic"

This folder includes two files that declare the global definitions and function
declarations :

	vbglobal.bas		Visual Basic 6.0
	vbglobal.NET.bas	Visual Basic .NET


NOTES

This example was written using Visual Basic V5.0. It uses GRAPH32.OCX and
GRID32.OCX. These DLLs have been removed from the later versions of Visual
Basic but the functionality is available in other OCXs. The following URL
has the details : http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;172193.

This example also uses DBGRID32.OCX, which is still as part of the standard
Visual Basic package but you may need to install it separately because it the default
installation does not install it. Further instructions are available here : http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vbcon98/html/vbconcontrolfilenames.asp.

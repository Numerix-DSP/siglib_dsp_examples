/* SigLib IIR filter cut off frequency shift test program
This program takes a four pole Butterworth low-pass filter with
Fc = 50 Hz and Fs = 1000 Hz and converts it into a low-pass filter with
Fc = 100 Hz and Fs = 10000 Hz.
The trick to this task is to use normalized sample rates or 1 Hz so
the source filter with Fc = 50 Hz and Fs = 1000 Hz is identical to a
filter with Fc = 0.05 Hz and Fs = 1 Hz and
the source filter with Fc = 100 Hz and Fs = 10000 Hz is identical to a
filter with Fc = 0.01 Hz and Fs = 1 Hz.
